Overused Emojis

## Project Overview
This is a part of the **ASAP Project** for the **Backend Web Development [V2]** course. In this task, we initiate the project by creating a README file that gives an overview of the project, its idea, and its features.

## Purpose
The main purpose of this task is to:
Write a clear, concise, and informative README for the project.
- How to use GitHub for version control through creating a new branch, committing changes, and pushing it to the repository.

## Features
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub
- **Branching**: Create and work on branches to create separate versions for different tasks.
- **Project Documentation**: Creating a README file that describes the project and its features.

## Steps Completed
1. Create a new local branch by executing the command `git checkout -b initialize-readme`.
2. Created a `README.md` file for the description of the project.
3. Added the changes, committed them, and pushed them to GitHub.

## Future
• Implement the project requirements as features.
• Documentation of the project and adding details as the project progresses.
